# Research Questions

1. How do institutional dynamics affect segregation based on affirmative action quotas?

--

2. Do these effects differ for advantaged versus disadvantaged students?

Why?

# Data

* 50 randomly sampled engineering colleges in India
 + 100 departments (2 per college)
 + 200 cohorts (2 per department)
 + 20,239 students


--

        
* Affirmative Action/Reservation
  + Quotas _reserved_ for students from historically disadvantaged backgrounds<sup>1</sup>
  + __Reservation students__: Those who gain admission based on these quotas
  + __Non-Reservation students__: Those who don't

.footnote[[1] Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs)]

* Directed network data for each cohort
  + Students nominate upto 10 friends
  + Longitudinal data - 2 time points (Gap of ~2 years)

## Segregation Levels

Non-reservation students tend to segregate more, and it sustains.

# Experimental Analysis
### How does diversity affect segregation?

---

# Model

In 37 of the 100 surveyed departments, students were randomly assigned _sections_ for all courses taken during the first two years of college.

<br/>
For a reservation/non-reservation student $i$ assigned a section $s$:

> $$seg_{i,s} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 diversity_{i,s} + \beta_2 stucontrols_i + \beta_3 dept_s + \epsilon_{i,s}$$


<br/>
  $diversity_{i,s}$ proxies:
  * Diversity of classmates in section
    + Proportion of classmates in section $s$ unlike student $i$
  * Diversity of faculty teaching a section
    + Proportion of faculty in section $s$ unlike student $i$
    

---

# Preliminary results

* A diverse student body reduces segregation for all students.

* A diverse faculty body increases segregation for non-reservation students.

# Quasi-Experimental Analysis
### How do institutional policies affect segregation?

---

# Method 1: Regression

For a reservation/non-reservation student $i$ at time points $t_1$ and $t_2$:
<br/><br/>

> $$seg_{i,t_2} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 policy_i + \beta_2 seg_{i,t_1} + \beta_3 stucontrols_i + \epsilon_i$$

<br/><br/>

--

$policy_i$ can be:

1. Maintaining diverse dormitories
2. Establishing mentoring programs
3. Holding integration seminars
4. A functional diversity office

---

# Preliminary Results

* Diverse dorms reduce segregation for non-reservation students throughout college.

* Mentoring programs reduce segregation for reservation students at the start of college, and for non-reservation student towards the end of college.

* Integration courses and Diversity offices have small effects towards reducing segregation.

# Method 2: Multilevel STERGM
### Model - Level 1

For each of the 200 classrooms, I run:

```{r, eval = F, echo=T}
stergm(
  list(network_t1, network_t2),
  formation = 
    ~ edges + nodefactor("reservation") + nodematch("reservation") + nodefactor("female") + nodematch("female") + nodefactor("ses") + nodematch("ses") + nodefactor("area") + nodematch("area") + nodecov("score") + absdiff("score") + mutual + gwesp(0.25),
  dissolution = 
    ~ edges + nodefactor("reservation") + nodematch("reservation") + nodefactor("female") + nodematch("female") + nodefactor("ses") + nodematch("ses") + nodefactor("area") + nodematch("area") + nodecov("score") + absdiff("score") + mutual + gwesp(0.25),
  estimate = "CMLE",
  times = 1:2,
  control = control.stergm(seed = 100, MLE.MCMC.burnin=50000, CMLE.MCMC.interval=2000)
)
```

No convergence for 27 classrooms

# Model - Level 2

Extracting model coefficients and standard errors from Level 1

Synthesizing effect sizes using a random effects model


Meta-regression using level 2 covariates:

1. Maintaining diverse dormitories
2. Establishing mentoring programs
3. Holding integration seminars
4. A functional diversity office

---

# Preliminary Results

### Level 1

* Reciprocal relations 78% likely to form and 83% likely to persist

* Clustered relations 63% likely to form and 65% likely to persist

* Homophilous connections based on affirmative action status 48% likely to form and persist

--

### Level 2

* Coefficient signs match regression model results (implicit policies reducing affirmative action based homophily), but not significant

### Questions

1. Reconcile network models (STERGMs, SOAMs) with econometric literature

2. Visualize multiple networks
  - Cluster?
